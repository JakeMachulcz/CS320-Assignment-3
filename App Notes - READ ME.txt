I used a mySQL database called 'assignment3' with a table called 'Logins' (we made this in Assignment 2), so those are where all the column names in the mySQL querys in the users.js file come from.

make sure in the command prompt to enter: >npm install express
					  >npm install
					  >npm install ejs
					
In database.js use your mySQL username and password.  If you don't have a password, just remove that line from the code.


The 'views' folder is where the html (or in this case ejs) files that show the webpages are:
	user-list.ejs	     = Home page (localhost:3000/)
	search-results.ejs   = Search results page (localhost:3000/search)
	math.ejs	     = Math page with user input fields (localhost:3000/math)
	math-results.ejs     = Math results page (localhost:3000/math-results)
